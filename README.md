Remove columns with missing values greater than 40% of dataset size.  4. Extract numeric data from columns property_price, square_area &amp; carpet_area using regular expressions. Make sure that units are standardized (all the values in property_price should be in lakhs)  5. In the above columns, fill empty values with mean of remaining data points 6. Convert columns facing, overlooking, ownership, transaction, furnishing into categorical variables by assigning values [0,1,2…].  7. In the above columns, fill empty values with 0.  8.
